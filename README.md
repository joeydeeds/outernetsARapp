# outernetsARapp

Small AR app that I tinkered with. I was interested in using ARkit, but since I was new to Swift, was a little overwhelmed. I've used React Native in the past with Expo, so I went there next. Expo's support is not great for AR. Then I found this, [Viro React.](https://viromedia.com/viroreact/)

An awesome project that had great documentation and could easily grasp it. I have a link to the app below if you want to see it in action. My idea was a golf game where you throw the balls into the hole, but ending up with more of a bowling game. I would definitely like to come back to this because it was fun.

Many ideas came to my head since discovering AR. I definitely want to check out ARKit and learn swift now, which is something I didn't expect going into this project.

## Running it locally

You will need an API Key from Viro, check out the quick start guide [here.](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/quick-start)

Then, simply clone this repo and run `npm install` and `npm start` once that finishes. Viro's guide is very helpful if you want to check there for resources. Feel free to open an issue in this repo as well and I will respond there. Thank you!
